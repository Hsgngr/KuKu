# #FormulaAI Hack 2022 - Challenge 1: Data Analytics 

Hi, We are Team KuKu and this repository outlines our approach to the [FormulaAI Hackathon](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/formula-ai-2022-hackathon/blob/main/challenges/challenge1.mdd). 

This year's theme was Weather Forecasting for Formula1. The data was provided by the [RedBull Racing eSports Team](https://f1esports.com/pro-championship/teams/red-bull) and It was gathered from the official Formula 1 video game developed by Codemasters. The goal of the task was to find a way to use the deeply nested historical weather data to make accurate weather predictions / forecasts.
