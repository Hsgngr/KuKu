# #FormulaAI Hack 2022 - Challenge 1: Data Analytics 

Hi, We are Team KuKu and this repository outlines our approach to the [FormulaAI Hackathon](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/formula-ai-2022-hackathon/blob/main/challenges/challenge1.mdd). 

This year's theme was Weather Forecasting for Formula1. The data was provided by the [RedBull Racing eSports Team](https://f1esports.com/pro-championship/teams/red-bull) and It was gathered from the official Formula 1 video game developed by Codemasters. The goal of the task was to find a way to use the deeply nested historical weather data to make accurate weather predictions / forecasts.

# Getting Started
This document aims to explain our solution in a deep technical-level. Since the challenge has also a presentation video, we kept the documentation as much as detailed as a reference. 
We used jupyter-notebooks to make data analysis workflow more visibly clear and interpretable. Also we created our own modules for readability and scalability.

* `main.ipynb` is our main notebook, which has simply every step from reading the data, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training and evaluation.
* `training.ipynb` is training of machine learning model for predicting price values also includes feature selection.
* `nlp.ipynb` is my attempt to predict the room size from the space column of airbnb data by utilizing NLP
* `data` folder includes raw and processed data
